# Journal â€” Week 2

This week, I'm going to answer the

> Who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work?

I think dedicated historians and governments pay for work to end up online. Hopefully, programmers and computers in "the Cloud" do most of the work!

> What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work?

A big ethical dimension that encompasses many others is the right to be forgotten. While saving public information is legal, and it's OK to record conversations you're involved in, the other parties involved will not have much control over whether they can take down any work you put online. Some historical documents, images, or audio could reflect badly on both living and dead persons. Dead persons definitely don't have as much control living persons over what is published about them.

> Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read?

The MacOdrum Library has a pleniful amount of both offline and online resources of archives. The most common one I can think of is maps of the city and schematics of buildings on the University's campus.

> What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you?

Many of Carleton University's resources are only accessible to people with a login, typically current/past students, faculty, staff, and librarians. Carleton likely also has partnerships with other universities, especially as Carleton students can borrow from uOttawa's libraries and vice-versa. Further, many of the materials are only meant for academic use and are not to be shared with others. I've ran into scenarios where people have asked me to impart private Carleton University credentials, but sharing them could get me into big trouble; that sort of ties in to the aforementioned ethical considerations.

> Where do you fit into this digital history machine?

I contribute to history all the time whether I'm consciously aware of it or not; such is the nature of big data. Myself, I sometimes contribute to archiving things that may vanish, and I like to have access to older versions of websites and documents that are no longer in their original place.
